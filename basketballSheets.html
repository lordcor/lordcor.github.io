     <h1>DYNAMIC SPORTS STATISTICS AND PREDICTIONS</h1>
        <p>A Dynamic Sports Prediction and Statistics Viewing Dashboard made in Google Sheets.</p>

        <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
        <p>
        I developed a dynamic sports statistics dashboard using Google Sheets, designed to track and analyze various statistics during the season for a sports league. This dashboard offers real-time data updates, a custom power ranking system, and score predictions for selected teams. It combines data from various sources, Solver optimization, and Monte Carlo simulations to provide a comprehensive analysis of the league's performance.
    </p>

        <h3>KEY FEATURES</h3>
         <ul>
			<li><b> <span>Real-time Data Integration:</span></b> The dashboard is connected to external data sources, ensuring that it is always up-to-date with the latest statistics, scores, and performance metrics.</li>
            <br>
           <li><b><span>Custom Power Raking System:</span></b> I created a unique power ranking system within the dashboard. This system utilizes Solver, a powerful optimization tool, to calculate the relative strengths of teams based on historical performance, enabling users to see how teams compare in real-time.</li>
          <br>
           <li><b><span>Monte Carlo Simulations:</span></b> To enhance the predictive capabilities of the dashboard, I incorporated Monte Carlo simulations. This statistical technique allows users to simulate various game scenarios and assess the likelihood of different outcomes, providing valuable insights into potential future performance.</li>
            <br>
           <li><b><span>User-Selectable Teams</span>:</b> Users can interact with the dashboard by selecting specific teams of interest. The dashboard provides in-depth statistics, analysis, and predictions for the chosen teams, making it a versatile tool for fans, analysts, and team management.</li>
            <br>
           <li><b><span>Score Predictions:</span></b> A backend prediction model is integrated into the dashboard, enabling users to input specific game scenarios and receive score predictions. This feature adds a layer of sophistication to the dashboard, making it an essential tool for anyone interested in predicting game outcomes..</li>
         </ul>

		<h3>BENEFITS AND IMPACT</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>The dynamic sports statistics dashboard simplifies the process of tracking and analyzing sports statistics, helping users make informed decisions, from predicting game outcomes to assessing team performance.</li>
		<br>
		<li>The custom power ranking system adds a unique dimension to the dashboard, allowing users to view teams' relative strengths in real-time.</li>
		<br>
		<li>The inclusion of Monte Carlo simulations enhances the accuracy of score predictions, offering valuable insights for fans, analysts, and sports enthusiasts.</li>
		</ul>

        <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
        <p>This project showcases my ability to create a dynamic and sophisticated sports statistics dashboard within Google Sheets, incorporating advanced analytical tools like Solver and Monte Carlo simulations. The user-friendly interface and real-time data integration make it a valuable resource for sports enthusiasts, analysts, and team management. The inclusion of a custom power ranking system and score prediction model further demonstrates my proficiency in leveraging data for informed decision-making.
