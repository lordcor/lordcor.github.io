        <h1>IMPROVE CUSTOMER RETENTION WITH DATA</h1>
        <p>Using findings from a local coffee shop dataset to investigate possible reasons for low customer return rate.</p>
        <h3>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h3>
        <p>Coffee House, a multinational coffeehouse chain headquartered in Seattle, Washington, faced a recent decline in customer retention rates, leading to a subsequent drop in revenue. After careful analysis of customer feedback and surveys, it was identified that the decline could be attributed to a lack of variety in product offerings, poor customer service, and increased competition. The data analysis project aimed to uncover insights into the factors contributing to this decline and propose data-driven solutions to improve customer retention. </p>
        <h3>TOOLS USED</h3>
        </p> I used a few different tools in order to complete the research that was needed in order to come to the conclusions provided. The tools used were:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>Plotly</li>
        <li>Seaborn</li>
        <li>Pandas</li>
        <li>Scipy</li>
        <li>Scikit-Learn</li>
        <li>Jupyter Notebook</li>
        </ul>

    <div id="test1-header" class="accordion_headings">METHODOLOGY</div>
    <div id="test1-content">
      <div class="accordion_child">
      <ul>
        <li><b> <span>Data Collection and Preparation:</span></b> The dataset, comprising customer feedback, surveys, and transaction records, underwent a meticulous cleaning process to address missing values and outliers. This ensured the dataset's integrity for subsequent analysis.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b><span>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</span></b> Descriptive statistics provided a snapshot of relevant variables, while visualizations, including charts and graphs, allowed for a deeper exploration of customer behavior and preferences. This phase unveiled key insights into the dynamics influencing retention rates.</li>
         <br>
         <li><b><span>Statistical Modeling:</span></b> Hypotheses were formulated based on EDA findings, and statistical models were selected to test these hypotheses. The analysis revealed significant factors impacting retention rates, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the issue.</li>
         <br>
          <li><b><span>Findings Presented:</span>:</b> Actionable insights were crafted to address the identified findings. </li>
          <br>
          <li><b><span>Visualization of Findings:</span></b> Various visualizations were created to visually relay the information from the survey data that was found from the project analysis. </li>
      </ul>
