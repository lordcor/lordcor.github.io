     <h1>IMPROVE CUSTOMER RETENTION WITH DATA</h1>
        <p>Using findings from a local coffee shop dataset to investigate possible reasons for low customer return rate.</p>

        <h3>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h3>
        <p>
        Coffee House, a multinational coffeehouse chain headquartered in Seattle, Washington, faced a recent decline in customer retention rates, leading to a subsequent drop in revenue. After careful analysis of customer feedback and surveys, it was identified that the decline could be attributed to a lack of variety in product offerings, poor customer service, and increased competition. The data analysis project aimed to uncover insights into the factors contributing to this decline and propose data-driven solutions to improve customer retention.
</p>

        <h3>OBJECTIVES</h3>
         <ul>
			<li><b> <span>Clean and Prepare Data:</span></b> Utilized the Spotify API and Spotipy to access and retrieve playlist data, including song attributes, play counts, and user interactions. Employed Python programming skills to automate data extraction.</li>
            <br>
           <li><b><span>Explore Data:</span></b> Conducted rigorous data cleansing and transformation to ensure data accuracy and consistency. Addressed missing values, removed duplicates, and standardized formats to enhance data quality.</li>
          <br>
           <li><b><span>Model Data:</span></b> Leveraged Looker Studio to design a dynamic and user-friendly dashboard. The dashboard included interactive elements, such as dropdowns and filters, to enable users to explore song play history, track details, and artist insights with ease.</li>
            <br>
           <li><b><span>Develop Solutions:</span>:</b> Incorporated interactive features, allowing users to filter and sort data based on various parameters such as song popularity, artist popularity, and genre. Users could explore trends and discover their favorite songs and artists more effectively.</li>
            <br>
           <li><b><span>Visualize Solutions:</span></b> Employed data visualizations, including charts and graphs, to present key insights. This enabled users to grasp trends and patterns in song play history and artist statistics quickly.</li>
         </ul>

		<h3>METHODOLOGY</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><b><span>Data Collection and Preparation:</span></b>The dataset, comprising customer feedback, surveys, and transaction records, underwent a meticulous cleaning process to address missing values and outliers. This ensured the dataset's integrity for subsequent analysis.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b><span>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</span></b>Descriptive statistics provided a snapshot of relevant variables, while visualizations, including charts and graphs, allowed for a deeper exploration of customer behavior and preferences. This phase unveiled key insights into the dynamics influencing retention rates.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b><span>Statistical Modeling:</span></b>Hypotheses were formulated based on EDA findings, and statistical models were selected to test these hypotheses. The analysis revealed significant factors impacting retention rates, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the issue.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b><span>Findings Presented:</span></b>Actionable insights were crafted to address the identified findings. </li>
        <br>
        <li><b><span>Visualization of Findings:</span></b>Various visualizations were created to visually relay the information from the survey data that was found from the project analysis. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>RESULTS</h3>
        <p>The data analysis project led to the following keyt findings:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Lack of variety in product offerings significantly impacted customer retention. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Improving customer service emerged as a crucial factor in retaining customers.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Strategic measures were proposed to counter increased competition.</li>
    </ul>
        <h3>IMPACT</h3>
        <p>The proposed solutions, when implemented, are anticipated to improve customer retention rates, subsequently boosting revenue for Coffee House.
		</p>
        <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
        <p>The data analysis project provided valuable insights into the factors affecting customer retention for Coffee House. The recommendations and solutions outlined aim to address the identified issues systematically. Ongoing monitoring and adjustments will be essential to ensure sustained improvements in customer retention.
