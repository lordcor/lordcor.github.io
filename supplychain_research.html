        <h1>Various Research Reports Based on Supply Chain</h1>
        <p>In these research projects, I looked at different factors for different industries and companies in those industries.  Companies such as  Microsoft and Alphabet, and Apple.  In the various research papers I explore and analyze different industries, I diagnose different enterprises, take a look at competition positioning, and finally, determine if a specific company has an inventory problem. </p>
        <br>
        </p> I used a few different tools in order to complete the research that was needed in order to come to the conclusions provided. The tools used were:
        <ul>
          <li>Microsoft Excel</li>
          <li>TradingView</li>
          <li>Global Competition Positioning System</li>
          <li>KPI Reports</li>
        </ul>

    <div id="test1-header" class="accordion_headings">INDUSTRY ANALYSIS</div>
    <div id="test1-content">
      <div class="accordion_child">
        <p>The research done  for this report included comparing different industries to each other, specifically Technology Hardware and Equipment,  Capital Goods, Healthcare Equipment and Services, Utilities, Energy, and Telecommunication Services.. The three indicators that  analysis was done on were:
        <ul>
        <li><b>PROFITABILITY -</b> The ability of industrial businesses to generate profits from their operations. It is a measure of how efficiently a company can produce goods or services and sell them at a price that covers the costs of production while also generating a surplus. Factors that affect industrial profitability include production costs, pricing strategies, market demand, competition, efficiency of operations, and economic conditions.</li>
        <li><b>EFFICIENCY -</b> Effectiveness with which resources are utilized in industrial processes to produce goods and services. It involves maximizing output while minimizing input, such as raw materials, energy, time, and labor costs. This can be achieved through various means including process optimization, technological advancements, and organizational improvements.</li>
        <li><b>GROWTH - </b>The expansion or increase in the output and productivity of industrial sectors within an economy over a specific period. It's typically measured by factors like the increase in the production of goods and services, expansion of industrial infrastructure, rise in employment opportunities within industrial sectors, and improvements in technological capabilities and efficiency.  It's often influenced by factors such as government policies, technological advancements, investments in infrastructure, and global economic trends.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p> The next section focused specifically on Technology Hardware and Equipment companies. A Concentration and Competition Intensity evaluation was performed by a specific  factor along side a Four-Firm Concentration Ratio evaluation on the sub industries. The key areas of focus were:
      <ul>
      <li><b>TOTAL REVENUE - IT</b></li>
      <li><b>TOTAL REVENUE - IT SUB DIVISIONS</b></li>
      <li><b>OPERATING INCOME OR LOSS</b></li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p> The final portion of this report focused on the stock market and the trends that could be seen for various different companies. This was done to show a different way  to indicate a companies success or failure within the industry.</p>

    <div id="test2-header" class="accordion_headings">INVENTORY PROBLEMS</div>
    <div id="test2-content">
      <div class="accordion_child">
        <h1>Inventory Problem Analysis</h1>
        <span class="left"><img src="/style/scanning-boxes.jpg" alt="example graphic" /></span>
        <p>
         Inventory problems within a company can include stockouts, excess supply, inaccuracy in counts,  slow  movement, and poor visibility.  For this report, A few indicators were analyzed to  determine whether or not a company showed signs of having an inventory problem.
         <ul>
         <li><b>INVENTORY DAYS - </b>also known as inventory days or days inventory outstanding (DIO), is a financial metric used to assess how efficiently a company manages its inventory. It measures the average number of days it takes for a company to sell its entire inventory.
         To calculate inventory days, you can use the following formula:</p>

         <p>Inventory Days = <span style="white-space: nowrap;">&#8704;</span> (Average Inventory) / (Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) / Number of Days) </p>


      This formula divides the average inventory by the cost of goods sold per day. A lower number of inventory days generally indicates that a company is selling its inventory more quickly, which can be a sign of efficiency.</li>
         <li><b>SIZE - </b>Inventory management is crucial for businesses of all sizes, but larger enterprises often have more complex systems due to the scale of their operations. These companies leverage economies of scale, advanced technology, and strategic planning to optimize their inventory levels and drive operational efficiency.</li>
         <li><b>EFFICIENCY - </b>the effectiveness and optimization of managing inventory within a business or organization. It primarily involves ensuring that the right amount of inventory is maintained at the right time, in the right place, and at the right cost to meet customer demand while minimizing excess inventory and associated costs. Efficient inventory management aims to strike a balance between having enough inventory to fulfill customer orders promptly and minimizing excess inventory that ties up capital and incurs storage costs. </li>
      </p>
      <p>To finish  up the report, analysis of company KPIs was done. These indicators helped to determine the financial stability of the company and dug deeper into the margins and assets that each company was dealing with. </p>

    <div id="test3-header" class="accordion_headings">ENTERPRISE DIAGNOSIS</div>
    <div id="test3-content">
      <div class="accordion_child">
        <p>Enterprise Diagnosis typically refers to the process of assessing and analyzing the various aspects of an organization to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. This diagnosis is often conducted to understand the overall health of the enterprise and to develop strategies for improvement or growth. In this report we looked at different components of each enterprise and broke  them down into tow different comparison methods.</p>
        <p>
        <h4>Value Driver Analysis</h4>

        <h5>ASSETS vs LIABILITY</h5>

        <h6>ROA: </h6>
        <ul>
       <li> Measures how efficiently a company is using its assets to generate profit. It's calculated by dividing the company's net income by its average total assets. </li>
       <li>ROA indicates the percentage of profit a company earns for each dollar of assets it owns. Higher ROA values indicate better asset utilization and profitability.</li>
       </ul>
       <h6>Liabilities:</h6>
       <ul>
       <li>Represent the financial obligations or debts that a company owes to creditors or other entities. These can include loans, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other obligations.</li>
       <li>Understanding a company's liabilities is essential for assessing its financial risk and solvency. High levels of liabilities relative to assets can indicate potential financial strain or risk.</li>
       </ul>
       In short, ROA evaluates how efficiently a company is using its assets to generate profit, while liabilities represent the financial obligations or debts that the company owes.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h5>MARGIN  vs TOTAL REVENUE - GROWTH</h5>

        <h6>Growth margin:</h6>
       <ul>
       <li> A financial metric that represents the percentage of revenue a company retains after accounting for the costs directly associated with producing goods or services sold. </li>
       <li>Growth margin indicates how efficiently a company is producing and selling its products or services. A higher growth margin suggests that the company is generating more profit from each sale.</li>
       </ul>
       <h6>Total Revenue:</h6>
       <ul>
       <li>Total revenue growth measures the percentage increase or decrease in a company's total revenue over a specific period, usually year over year.</li>
       <li>Total revenue growth reflects the overall performance of a company in terms of its ability to increase sales and expand its customer base.</li>
       </ul>
       Essentially, growth margin focuses on the profitability of each sale, while total revenue growth assesses the overall growth trajectory of a company's revenue. Both metrics are important for understanding different aspects of a company's financial health and performance.
          </p>
      <p>
     <h5>GROSS PROFIT vs TOTAL ASSETS</h5>

     <h6>Gross Profit:</h6>
     <ul>
     <li>This is the revenue a company earns minus the cost of goods sold (COGS). It reflects the efficiency of a company's production or service provision before accounting for other expenses like operating expenses, taxes, interest, and depreciation.</li>
     </ul>
     <h6>Total :</h6>
     <ul>
     <li>These are all the resources a company owns, controls, or has a right to use in order to generate income. This includes tangible assets like property, equipment, and inventory, as well as intangible assets like patents and trademarks.</li>
     </ul>
     Analyzing the relationship between gross profit and total assets can provide insights into how efficiently a company is utilizing its assets to generate profit. A higher ratio of gross profit to total assets suggests better utilization and efficiency, while a lower ratio may indicate inefficiencies or under utilization of assets. It's important to consider industry norms and other financial metrics when interpreting this ratio.
     </p>
 </p>
 <p>
 <h4>Enterprise Breakdowns</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>Revenue  - </b>Refers to the total income generated by a business from its primary activities, such as selling goods or services to other businesses (B2B) or consumers (B2C). This revenue typically excludes any income from non-operating activities like investments or asset sales. In the context of larger organizations, enterprise revenue encompasses income streams from all divisions, subsidiaries, and business units within the enterprise.</li>
<li><b>Liability - Equity - </b> Involves understanding how the liabilities of a business impact its equity position, risk management strategies, financial reporting, capital structure decisions, and investor perceptions. Factors that are to be considered include, Risk Management, Financial Reporting, Capital Structure and Investor Confidence.</li>
<li><b>Detailed Assets - </b>Detailed assets of an enterprise typically refer to the specific items or categories of assets that a company owns or has invested in. These assets are often listed on a balance sheet or financial statement and can include various types such as Inventory, Investments, Property, Intangibles, Cash, And Expenses. Detailed assets are essential for understanding the financial health and performance of a company and are typically reported in financial statements to provide transparency to investors, creditors, and other stakeholders.</li>

    <div id="test4-header" class="accordion_headings">COMPETITION POSITIONING</div>
    <div id="test4-content">
      <div class="accordion_child">
        <p>Enterprise competition positioning involves analyzing where a company stands in relation to its competitors in terms of market share, product offerings, pricing strategies, target audience, and overall brand image.: Researching case studies or industry reports on specific enterprises can provide insights into their strategies for positioning themselves in the market and gaining a competitive edge.</p>
        <p> For this report I took a look at two different methods for analysis. The first was done by looking at Enterprise Rankings in different categories, and the second was a deeper dive into KPI charts. </p>
       <p> KPIs were mentioned in a pervious section so there won't be further information regarding the use of them. </p>

      <p>
      <h4>Enterprise Rankings</h4>
      <ul>
      <li><b>TOTAL REVENUE - </b> The total amount of money generated by a business or organization from all its operations and activities within a specific period, typically a fiscal year. This includes revenue from sales of goods or services, as well as any other sources of income such as investments, royalties, or licensing fees. It provides a comprehensive view of the overall financial performance of the enterprise, reflecting its ability to generate income from various sources. Total revenue is a key metric used by investors, analysts, and stakeholders to assess the size and growth of a company's business operations.</li>
      <li><b>OPERATING INCOME OR LOSS - </b> A financial metric that reflects the profitability of a company's core operations, excluding certain non-operating items such as interest income, interest expenses, and taxes. It is calculated by subtracting the operating expenses from the gross operating revenue. This metric provides insight into how well a company is generating profit from its primary business activities, such as sales of goods or services, without considering the impact of financial activities or taxes. </li>
      <li><b>TOTAL REVENUE GROWTH RATE - </b>Refers to the percentage increase in a company's total revenue over a specific period compared to a previous period. It's a key metric used to evaluate the overall financial health and performance of a business. This growth rate indicates how effectively a company is generating revenue from its core operations and can be a measure of its competitiveness and market expansion. Calculating this rate involves comparing the total revenue at the end of the current period with the total revenue at the end of the previous period, typically expressed as a percentage. It's an important indicator for investors, analysts, and management to assess the company's trajectory and make informed decisions about future strategies and investments.</li>
